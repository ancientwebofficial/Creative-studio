# ✨ What is Creative portfolio?

**Creative portfolio** is an open-source portfolio platform built for designers, thumbnail artists, creative studios, freelancers, and digital creators.

Instead of managing content through code, Creative portfolio provides a modern CMS where you can customize every part of your portfolio—from your homepage and projects to testimonials, pricing, FAQs, services, and owner profile.

Whether you're a Minecraft thumbnail designer, logo artist, video editor, or creative agency, Cosmicflare gives you everything you need to present your work professionally.
